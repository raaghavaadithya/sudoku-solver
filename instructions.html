    <h3>About :</h3>
    <p>
      This is an app which lets us play the game of <strong>Sudoku</strong>. The
      unique feature of this app is that it lets us
      <strong>visualize</strong> the <strong>Bactracking</strong> process that
      is used to solve the board.
    </p>
    <h3>How to play :</h3>
    <div class="lists"><ul>
      <li>
        The first step is to enter the numbers into the board. We can use the
        number pads on screen, or we can use our keyboards to enter the numbers.
        We can also use the arrow keys to move around easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        After entering the initial numbers, we can click <strong>Done</strong>.
        If the board is unsolvable / invalid, we'll need to fix it before moving
        on. If the board is valid, we can start solving.
      </li>
      <li>
        We can enter the numbers using the keyboard or the number pad on screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the entered number is correct, it will be locked and we can't change
        it again.
      </li>
      <li>If the entered number is wrong, it will blink red and go blank.</li>
      <li>
        Once the board is solved, we can click on <strong>New Board</strong> to
        clear everything and start a new game.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visualizing Backtracking :</h3>
    <div class="lists"><ul>
      <li>
        At any point, if we want to visualize the backtracking process, we can
        click the <strong>Solve</strong> button and the app starts solving the
        board using the backtracking algorithm.
      </li>
      <li>
        We can control the speed of the animations by simply changing the slider
        on top.
      </li>
      <li>Once the animations are done, we will have a solved board!</li>
      <li>
        Once the board is solved, we can click on <strong>New Board</strong> to
        clear everything and start a new game.
      </li>
    </ul>
