# Sudoku Solver

View app at: https://raaghavaadithya.github.io/sudoku-solver/

This is an app that lets us play the classic game Sudoku, but can also solve it automatically while showing us how it solves the puzzle. The unique feature of this app is that it visually shows the backtracking algorithm working.

## How it works / How to play
* You start with a partially solved board. You must fill the remaining part with the appropriate numbers.
* You can also start with an empty board if you wish by clicking on "Reset Board", and manually enter a puzzle.
* You can enter numbers through the keyboard or the number pad provided. You can also move around the board with the arrow keys.

## Auto complete
* At any given time, we can click the "Solve" button to automatically solve the entire board.
* The app uses the Backtracking technique to solve the board, and will show us visually how that process happens.
