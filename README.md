# Sudoku Solver
This is an app that lets us play the classic game Sudoku, but can also solve it automatically while showing us how it solves the puzzle. The main feature of this app is that it visually shows the backtracking algorithm working.

## How it works / How to play
* We first have to manually fill the board with a valid "starting hand", and then click "Done".
* We can then start solving the puzzle on our own.
* If the entered number is invalid/incorrect, it will turn red and not get entered. If it was the correct number, then it gets placed and can't be changed again.
* Upon clicking "Done" in the beginning, if the board is invalid / unsolvable, we will see a prompt saying so and we'll have to change the board.

## Auto complete
* At any given time, we can click the "Solve" button to automatically solve the entire board.
* The app uses the Backtracking technique to solve the board, and will show us visually how that process happens.

The main features of the app are done, but a few more changes will be made later in order to improve the User Experience.
