# Sudoku Solver
This is an app that lets you play Sudoku, but can also solve it automatically while showing us how it solves the puzzle.

## How it works
* You first have to manually fill the board with a valid "starting hand"
* You can then start solving the puzzle on your own.
* If the entered number is invalid/incorrect, it will turn red and not get entered. If it was the correct number, then it gets placed and can't be changed again.
* Upon solving the whole puzzle, the puzzle turns green to indicate it.
* After finishing entering the numbers in the beginning, if the board is invalid, you will see a prompt saying so and you'll have to change the board.

## Auto complete
* At any given time, you can click the "Solve" button to automatically solve the entire board.
* The app will show visually how the program is solving the board.
* The app can terminate if the board is unsolvable.

This is a work in progress
